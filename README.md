# swordGL
This is a very simple openGL Engine

# 2016.5.31
This is my first project on github,I do this for my large operations of Computer Graph.
Everything is hard for a student,but I think I do the best.Now, the school term is coming 
to an end,sworldGL will be ending soon also(with so mang bug),I will have a new starting point,
everything will be well
